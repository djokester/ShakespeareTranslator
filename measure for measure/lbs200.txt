Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.In most uneven and distracted manner. His actionsshow much like to madne pray heaven his wisdom benot tainted! And why meet him at the gates, andredeliver our authorities there[?]I guess not.And why should we proclaim it in an hour before hisentering, that if any crave redress of injustice,they should exhibit their petitions in the street?He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch ofcomplaints, and to deliver us from deviceshereafter, which shall then have no power to standagainst us.Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimesi’ the morn; I’ll call you at your house: givenotice to such men of sort and suit as are to meethim.I shall, sir. Fare you well.Good night.This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnantAnd dull to all proceedings. A deflower’d maid!And by an eminent body that enforcedThe law against it! But that her tender shameWill not proclaim against her maiden loss,How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;For my authority bears of a credent bulk,That no particular scandal once can touchBut it confounds the breather. He should have lived,Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,Might in the times to come have ta’en revenge,By so receiving a dishonour’d lifeWith ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,Nothing goes right: we would, and we would nota reference to Romans 7:15we would, and we would not.#LBSFORGOLD#LBSFORGOLD
