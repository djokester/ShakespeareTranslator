When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,For all the day they view things unrespected;But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,And, darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright—How would thy shadow’s form form happy showTo the clear day with thy much clearer light,When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so?How would, I say, mine eyes be blessèd madeBy looking on thee in the living day,When in dead night thy fair imperfect shadeThrough heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay?  All days are nights to see till I see thee,  And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.#LBSFORGOLDMy eyes work best when I’m asleep, because all day they look at things I don’t care about. When I sleep, my dreaming eyes alight on you and glitter brightly in the dark, having found your bright image there. Given that your shadowy dream-image brightens even the dark, how bright might you appear in daylight, when your own light is so much clearer? How bright, when your shadow shines so brightly to my eyes blinded by darkness? What good would it do my eyes to see you in the daytime when they already look at your beautiful image in the dead of night, as I sleep? Every day is as dark as night until I get to see you again, and every night is as bright as day when I see you in my dreams.
