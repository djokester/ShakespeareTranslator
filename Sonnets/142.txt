Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.O but with mine compare thou thine own state,And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,That have profaned their scarlet ornamentsAnd sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,Robbed others' beds' revénues of their rents.Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov’st thoseWhom thine eyes woo as mine impórtune thee.Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows,Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.  If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,  By self-example mayst thou be denied.#LBSFORGOLDLoving you is my sin, and your precious virtue consists in hating my sin, a hate grounded in your own sinful loving. But compare my moral state with your own, and you’ll see I don’t deserve to be reprimanded, or if I do, not from those lips of yours, which you’ve dishonored by using too much. Your lips have kissed as many people and made as many false promises as mine have, and both of us have cheated on our partners, giving away sexual favors where they don’t belong. If I may be allowed to love you the same way you love those other men whom you seduce with your glances, have a little pity for me; then you’ll deserve to be pitied yourself. If you want people to take pity on you and sleep with you, but you don’t show pity for me, you might be turned down because of your own example.
