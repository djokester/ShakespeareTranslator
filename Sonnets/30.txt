When to the sessions of sweet silent thoughtI summon up remembrance of things past,I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,And with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste.Then can I drown an eye unused to flow,For precious friends hid in death’s dateless night,And weep afresh love’s long since cancelled woe,And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,And heavily from woe to woe tell o'erThe sad account of fore-bemoanèd moan,Which I new pay as if not paid before.  But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,  All losses are restored, and sorrows end.#LBSFORGOLDWhen I sit alone in silence and remember the past, I get depressed about all the things I don’t have that I once strived for, and I add to old griefs new tears for all the valuable time I’ve wasted. Then I can drown my eyes, which are not usually wet from crying, in tears for precious friends who are dead, and I can weep again for hurts in loves that are long since over and moan about the loss of many things I’ll never see again. Then I can grieve about grievances I had let go of and sadly recount each woe that I’d already cried about in the past, feeling the pain all over again, as if I hadn’t suffered over these things already. But if I think about you, my dear friend, while I’m doing all of this, I get back everything I’d lost, and all my sorrows end.
