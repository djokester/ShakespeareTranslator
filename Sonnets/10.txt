For shame deny that thou bear’st love to any,Who for thyself art so unprovident.Grant if thou wilt, thou art belov’d of many,But that thou none lov’st is most evident;For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hateThat ‘gainst thyself thou stick’st not to conspire,Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinateWhich to repair should be thy chief desire.O change thy thought, that I may change my mind.Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?Be as thy presence is, gracious and kind,Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove.  Make thee another self for love of me,  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.#LBSFORGOLDIf you have any sense of shame, admit that you don’t have any love in your heart for anyone, since you’re so unwilling to care about yourself. I’ll admit, if you like, that many people love you, but it’s also obvious that you love no one. For you are so possessed with murderous hatred that you have no problem plotting against yourself, seeking to destroy the house that you should want to repair. Oh, change your way of thinking, so I can change my mind about you. Should hate have a more beautiful home than love? Be gracious and kind, like your appearance—or at least be kind-hearted to yourself. Have a child out of love for me, so your beauty will live on in your children, if not in you.
