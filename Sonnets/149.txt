Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not,When I against myself with thee partake?Do I not think on thee, when I forgotAm of myself, all, tyrant, for thy sake?Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?On whom frown’st thou that I do fawn upon?Nay, if thou lour’st on me, do I not spendRevenge upon myself with present moan?What merit do I in myself respect,That is so proud thy service to despise,When all my best doth worship thy defect,Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?  But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;  Those that can see thou lov’st, and I am blind.#LBSFORGOLDOh, you cruel woman, can you say I don’t love you when I take sides with you against myself? Don’t I think about you even when I’ve forgotten about myself—and all for your sake, you tyrant? Who hates you that I would call my friend? Who do you frown at that I grovel on and flatter? No—if you scowl at me, don’t I immediately punish myself by moaning? Which quality do I see in myself that would make me too proud to be your servant? All of the best in me worships the worst in you, and you can command me with a glance. But, my love, go on hating me, because now I know your mind. You love people who can see, and I’m blind.
