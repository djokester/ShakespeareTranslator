Your love and pity doth th' impression fillWhich vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow;For what care I who calls me well or ill,So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?You are my all the world, and I must striveTo know my shames and praises from your tongue;None else to me, nor I to none alive,That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.In so profound abysm I throw all careOf others' voices, that my adder’s senseTo critic and to flatt’rer stoppèd are.Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:  You are so strongly in my purpose bred  That all the world besides methinks y'are dead.#LBSFORGOLD
