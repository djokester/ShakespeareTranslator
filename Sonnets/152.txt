In loving thee thou know’st I am forsworn;But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,In vowing new hate after new love bearing.But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,When I break twenty? I am perjured most,For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,And all my honest faith in thee is lost;For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,Or made them swear against the thing they see.  For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured eye,  To swear against the truth so foul a lie.#LBSFORGOLDI know I’m breaking a promise by loving you, but you, swearing you love me, are breaking two promises: cheating on your husband by leaving his bed, then breaking your promise to your new lover by vowing to hate him. But why am I accusing you of breaking two oaths when I break twenty? I am perjured the most, because all of my vows are only made to mislead and exploit you; I’m no longer true to you. For I have sworn great oaths about how kind you are, oaths about your love, your faithfulness, your constancy. And to make you look better I blinded myself, swearing to the opposite of what I actually saw. For I have sworn that you are beautiful; my eye is doubly a liar, offering such a foul lie after swearing to tell the truth.
