We are enough yet living in the fieldTo smother up the English in our throngs,If any order might be thought upon.The devil take order now! I’ll to the throng.Let life be short, else shame will be too long.#LBSFORGOLDThere are enough of us still alive in the field to overcome the English with our numbers if we could just restore some kind of order.The hell with order! I’m going back into battle. Let life be short so that shame won’t last too long.
