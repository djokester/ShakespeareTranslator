A goodly city is this Antium. City,’Tis I that made thy widows: many an heirOf these fair edifices ’fore my warsHave I heard groan and drop: then know me not,Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stonesIn puny battle slay me.Save you, sir.And you.Direct me, if it be your will,Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?He is, and feasts the nobles of the stateAt his house this night.Which is his house, beseech you?This, here before you.Thank you, sir: farewell.O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,Are still together, who twin, as ’twere, in loveUnseparable, shall within this hour,On a dissension of a doit, break outTo bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,To take the one the other, by some chance,Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friendsAnd interjoin their issues. So with me:My birth-place hate I, and my love’s uponThis enemy town. I’ll enter: if he slay me,He does fair justice; if he give me way,I’ll do his country service.#LBSFORGOLD#LBSFORGOLD
