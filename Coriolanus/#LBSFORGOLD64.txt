So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatchThose centuries to our aid: the rest will serveFor a short holding: if we lose the field,We cannot keep the town.Fear not our care, sir.Hence, and shut your gates upon’s.Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.#LBSFORGOLD
