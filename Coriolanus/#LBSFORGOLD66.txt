I’ll fight with none but thee; for I do hate theeWorse than a promise-breaker.We hate alike:Not Afric owns a serpent I abhorMore than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.Let the first budger die the other’s slave,And the gods doom him after!If I fly, Martius,Holloa me like a hare.Within these three hours, Tullus,Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,And made what work I pleased: ’tis not my bloodWherein thou seest me mask’d; for thy revengeWrench up thy power to the highest.Wert thou the HectorThat was the whip of your bragg’d progeny,Thou shouldst not scape me here.Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed meIn your condemned seconds.#LBSFORGOLD
