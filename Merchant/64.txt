I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee.And Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou seeLorenzo, who is thy new master’s guest.Give him this letter.
(gives LAUNCELOT
        a letter)
    Do it secretly.And so farewell. I would not have my fatherSee me in talk with thee.Adieu! Tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful pagan,
most sweet Jew! If a Christian do not play the knave and
get thee, I am much deceived. But adieu. These foolish
drops do something drown my manly spirit. Adieu.
Farewell, good Launcelot.Alack, what heinous sin is it in meTo be ashamed to be my father’s child!But though I am a daughter to his blood,I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,Become a Christian and thy loving wife.#LBSFORGOLDI’m sorry you’re leaving my father like this. It’s hell in
        our house, and you helped cheer it up, like a funny devil. But goodbye. Here’s a
        ducat for you. You’ll soon be meeting Lorenzo at supper; he’ll be a guest
        of your new master. Give him this letter. (gives LAUNCELOT
        a letter) Do it secretly. Goodbye. I don’t want my
        father to see me talking to you.Goodbye. My tears show you my feelings, my beautiful pagan, my sweet Jew! I’m
        sure some Christian will resort to trickery to get you. But goodbye. It’s not manly
        to cry. Goodbye.Goodbye, Launcelot.Oh God, what a heinous sinner I am, being ashamed to be my father’s child! But
        I need to remember I’m related to him by blood, not behavior. Oh Lorenzo, if you
        keep your promise to me, I’ll end this agony by becoming a Christian and marrying
        you.
